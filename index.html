                  <h3>Improv Basics</h3>
                  <p>   The first rule in improv is to very simply just say, "Yes" to anything.  Which leads right to
                     the second rule, which is to add something, commonly refered to "and".  "And" is how we build our
                     reality and everything that we are on stage. YES with these two powerful tools AND a good attitude and 
                     willingness to play with others. Any reality is possible. <br>
                        However just like everything else, to get better at imporv, it takes some instruction and lots of 
                     practice to properly use these tools.  Once the work is put in, and there is a lot of fun
                     along the way so its hard to call it work, then you get to start performing.  There is nothing better
                     than the feeling of joy after a good show.

                  <h3>Classes</h3>
               <p id="classPara">   I started taking classes at The Improv Shop 3 and a half years ago. When I went through the classes there were six levels.
                  These six levels taught us how to preform a long form improv style.  Many people are familiar with short form improv, from 
                  one of my fav shows "Who's Line is it Anyways".  On this show they play a bunch of little short form games.  They are set up
                  before hand and then given a suggestion to kick it off.<br>
                     In long form improv you get a suggestion, and then you make up a play or a sketch.  So each scene is completely made up,
                  with only the suggestion to influence everything.  Scenes usually run from 1 minute to 10 minutes, though sometimes they can be the 
                  whole show, thats called a Monoscene.  A typical show has about 9 scenes in them.  <br>
                     All in all its about a years worth of classes. That's one year of being goofy and fun on stage, making friends, and seeing really funny
                  shows and people all along the way.
               </p>

                 <h3>Practice</h3>
                  <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Practice is the best way to build improv skill and to gain team synergy.  Most people think practice will be boring,
                      but its like one part structured exercises, then 5 part good old fun improv.  However those exercises are very important will help you impove different 
                      parts of your improv game.  It's comparable to working out.  Bicep curls help improv bicep strength.  Many of these exercises target certain aspects of improv for improvement.  <br>

                     <br>
                  Most of on stage improv is about trust.  The trust you have in each other to support and say yes to any decisions you make on stage.
                  That comes from hanging out and being vulnerable with each other. The only thing you need for practice is a space and a <a href="https://www.can-i-get-a.com/">suggestion</a> and you are good to go.
                  Another type of practice would be doing something like having a podcast with your teammates.
                  Even doing stand-up and flexing creative muscles would be a form of practice.

                        Once you take some classes and get through some practices to help build skills and team synergy,
                     comes the best part.  Shows. While shows can all vary from good to not so fun, and the crowds ranges
                     from 0 people to 100. There is nothing better than coming off stage, after you have put all your hard
                     work in to it, and having people come up and say, "Great show, which one of you wrote it?".  When it 
                     all works perfect, your completely made up show, will look like a well rehearsed play. Its such a great 
                     space for a show they often record Stand up specials for instance,
